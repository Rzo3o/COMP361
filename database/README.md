# Database Module

This module handles all interactions with the SQLite database. It provides an abstraction layer so that gameplay code does not need to write raw SQL.

**Files:**
- `db_manager.py`: Unified interface for database operations.
- `models.py`: (Optional) If strictly data models are needed here, though `gameplay/` might be better for implementation classes.

> **It is MANDATORY to modify this README for any modification made in this subfolder.**
